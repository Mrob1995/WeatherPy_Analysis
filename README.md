# WeatherPy_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Using a set of user-input parameters, we performed a series of API calls to find a randomized list of hotels around the world that would fall within the user's chosen temperature range. This information was then used to establish a 5 city route for a vacation.
